These files were compiled from LandSat8 using javascript files in Google Earth Engine users/valaasam/LuxuryEffectNYC (https://code.earthengine.google.com/6770a570fc89350cc56f689f6fc5208e)

Scripts were adapted from here: https://github.com/NewYorkCityCouncil/heat_map/blob/main/README.md

Rasters were clipped to NYC boundaries of Manhattan, Bronx, New York (which is Manhattan and Brooklyn, looks like), Richmond, Rockland, and Queens. Westchester also included but clipped as a separate file because it was too complex of a shape.  

Files contain per pixel summaries of land surface temperature mean, median, min, and max over winter (months Dec-Feb) and summer (months June-Aug) from January 1, 2020 to Dec 1, 2023.
